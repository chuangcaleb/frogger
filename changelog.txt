# Current Objectives // 460 548

- document
- load sprites in
- use a decorator design pattern? State design for scenes?
- identifier parameter for what log/car type

LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES
- README
- high level class diagram
- Javadocs
- Video
- Start Screen w/ picture -> Info button explaining game op
- High Score popup at the end of every round, showing scores from each round, highest at the top
- Refactor code w/ design patterns
- Organize the code to adhere to the MVC pattern
- Create a permanent high score list (using a file to store scores)
- Add interesting levels to the game (either follow the original Frogger game levels or come up with your own ideas)
- Add meaningful JUnit tests
- Use build files (Ant or Maven or Gradle)

! if player spams downwards on bottom boundary, will misalign with grid because of second animation
! if player does a diagonal combo, the frog will be stuck in second state

# 0.8 JavaFXML and MVC 25/11/20
###############################

- Used SceneBuilder to create game.fxml, home.fxml and info.fxml
- changed SceneSwitcher to pass fxml files instead of Worlds, and uses fxml to load each root, and makes a Scene with that root
- properly made Controller classes to handle events of buttons from the view, that calls switchScene()
- added the Game model to handle the data and logic during the game

- added constant/Global.java to keep track of global variables if they needed to be changed
- renamed act() to tick()

- moved all the images under resources/images ###
- resources/view
- resources/css
- added resources/fonts/EarlyGameboy.ttf for custom fonts
- Removed iKogsKW.png

- commented out Home.java and State.java
- renamed World.java to Level.java

######################################################
# 0.7 Resources, DyanamicActors and Obstacles 23/11/20
######################################################

- Deleted BackgroundImage
- Renamed Actor into DynamicActor and made it inherit a new class called Actor
    > Actor is for all general sprite objects to add into World
    > DynamicActor are for non-static sprites that need to have tick updates and collision checks
- updated Actor, DynamicActor and World to have their declarations and methods to use the new proper class types
    > applied Liskov's Substitution Principle: Actor can be replaced with DynamicActor
- removed the String imageLink parameter for all constructors of the subclasses of Actor, since they all have their own default sprite (except log and car)
- updated the constructors and some FilePaths for obstacles
- animation methods for Turtles
- added class Car.java, similar to Log

- renamed WetTurtles images


#####################################################
# 0.6 Refactored Structure and Frog Movement 20/11/20
#####################################################

REFACTORED STRUCTURE
- removed HomeController and HomeView (they are still there, commented out, if there might be use for them)
- made Main.java call a new class, SceneSwitcher, a singleton that handles switching scenes
- SceneSwitcher has switchScene() which takes a World and sets its Scene for Main.primaryStage, besides assigning event handler for keystrokes to the World
- World has two methods, keyPressed and keyReleased as the event handler methods which calls frog.leap

CONSTANTS
- Direction.java is an enum that keeps the list of cardinal directions
- Keystroke.java is a class that has a HashMap that matches the WASD KeyCode to their direction
- FilePath.java is a class that stores public static final Strings of the filepaths of resources

FROG SPRITES AND MOVEMENT REDESIGNED
- changed Frog's constructor to include starting co-ords and image size
- two new ArrayLists, facingSprites and leapingSprites
- initSprites() loads these arrays with newly instantiated Images
- leap() takes in direction and which key event is coming in
    > handles exceptions
    > switch statement for each scenario
        > checks for ignoring key events that try to escape boundaries

MISC
- added more parameters to Actor's constructor (+ double startX, double startY, int width, int height)
- cleaned up temporary debug code
- general documentation for all affected code


###########################################
# 0.5 First MVC Module and Music 18/11/20
###########################################

- cleaned up Main.java
- under java/frogger, introduced folders const, util, controller and view
- new HomeView.java and HomeController.java to handle main menu page display and logic respectively (according to MVC pattern)
- Refactored out MyStage
    > HomeView to handle its World extension
    > MusicPlayer to handle music methods

- new MusicPlayer.java as a singleton to handle background music
    > Instead of singleton object, made it as singleton class
- Renamed main/resources/frogger/sound folder to music


###########################################
# 0.4 Frog Movement and Cleanup 16/11/20
###########################################

- Actor.java
    > STAGE_HEIGHT and STAGE_WIDTH constants
    > Javadoc comments
- Animal.java
    > Javadoc comments
    > WATER_HEIGHT
    > GRID_UNIT_L
    > changed rebound value from 2*movement to just movement. Follows the grid.
    > player rebounds on top and bottom boundary
    ! if player spams downwards on any boundary, will misalign with grid because of second animation
- Refactored Animal class renamed to Frog
- Main.java: Renamed animal to frog


###########################################
# 0.3 Element Sizes 15/11/20
###########################################

- resize scene/stage to have a proper grid-like pattern
    H: 40 + 32 + 5*32=160 + 32 + (2+32+2)*5=180 + 52 + 52 == 548
    W: 22 + 13*32 + 22 = 460
- Resized GameBackground.png
- Animal.java
    > both movement directions to have speed of 17
    > static final int for starting coordinates
>> Still need to do boundary wrap checking and fitting


###########################################
# 0.2 Project Workspace Cleanup 15/11/20
###########################################

- updated .gitignore and removed .DS_Store from repo. Hope it works
- set up resource file, and added frogger subfolder
    > refactored code to accommodate subfolder
- deleted (java)docs folder
- renamed changelog file
- cleaned up Main.java file's obstacle bulk



###########################################
# 0.1 Javadocs and File Structure 13/11/20
###########################################

- javadocs 'docs' folder
- file structure reorganisation according to MVC pattern
    > made src/java/frogger as source root directory
    > put all the non-java files into "resources" folder
        > further sub-categorized according to resource type
    > Refactored links/path of methods that use resources
- resized GameBackground to 600x800
- deleted redundant files
    > old README.md
    > frog background-20170521-151438.piskel
    > smiiling-big-eyed-green-frog-clipart-6926.jpg
