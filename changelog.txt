# 1.1 Hotfix 18/12/20
#####################

- Commented out all occurrences of DeathType.TIMER


#######################
# 1.0 Release 18/12/20
#######################

- Added Table of Contents to README
- Commented out DeathMessages#TimerDeathMessages

######################################
# 0.19 Final Cleanup 16/12/20
######################################

- cleaned up code,
- cleared warnings
- defined constants locally

- comments
- javaDocs

Feats
- TutorialFrog: doesnt reset progress to 100 if at 101
- LevelConfigs#getLibrary() removed
  	- #levelConfigLibrary -> static final LEVEL_CONFIG_LIBRARY, using that as ref instead of INSTANCE
- LaneBuilder now reports invalid startXPerc inputs

Refactoring
- renamed Global to StageDimensions
- ScorePopupController#passFields renamed to init()
	- #FINAL_LEVEL -> #LAST_LEVEL, semantics of constant formatting
- HomeController#dsiplayConfirmationButton() -> showConfirmationButton()
- SceneSwitcher -> StageManager
- magic numbers in LaneBuilder
- CollisionChecker#checkAuto -> checkPanning
	- aActorBounds -> pActorBounds
- Test cases to remove access modifier in Junit5
- Tightened access modifiers
- MovableActor#A_ACTOR_HEIGHT -> PanningActor#P_ACTOR_HEIGHT
	- PanningActors no longer take in a height argument, since height is standard
- All PanningActor's constructor takes speed as an integer instead of double
	- The actual PanningActor#speed is still double, since #setSpeed multiplies by 0.1
- Frog's keyPressed -> keystrokeDownwards
	- Frog breaks movement if at all it has noMove
	- Frog endLevel does not return score; another method is called. Single responsibility
	- Intro'd a ton of new constants
- ActorDimensions#GRID_UNIT_W -> CAR_W
- Turtles FilePaths to be like Frog's, root and default, saving constants

Sprites
- set all sprites to be static final, instead of instantiated every time a new object is instantiated

- renamed file Frogger Main Song Theme (loop).mp3 -> FroggerTheme_loop.mp3
- FilePath


######################################
# 0.18 LevelConfig & Tutorial 12/12/20
######################################

LevelConfig
- changed LevelBuilder into LevelConfig, a singleton under const, as a library of an ArrayList of an ArrayList of Panning Actors
	- This means CollisionHandler can refer to LevelConfig's library size

Tutorial
- Extension of familiar classes
	- Info extends Game
	- TutorialLevel extends Level
	- TutorialFrog extends Frog
	- InfoController extends GameController
- Methods overridden to exact new functionalities
- Changed some methods and fields from private to protected to implement extension

- LaneBuilder's x coordinate wrap multiplier 2 -> 4
- moved removeScore(100) from playDeathAnim() to CollisionHandler.frogDies()


####################################
# 0.17 Refac & Death Msg 12/12/20
####################################

Refactoring
- Moved numEndsActivated handling from Level to CollisionHandler
- Some refactoring about Frog and Game's handling of touchEnd

Death message
- CollisionHandler.dies() to handle death message passing to game controller

- getRandMsg()

- removed frog.initSprites(), just init'ed the sprites straight away
- made HiscoreReaderTest cleaner
- moved addEventHandler to Game, kept locally
- readme draft


####################################
# 0.16 Total Hiscores 9/12/20
####################################

ScorePopupController
- moved here HiscoreWriter method init from Game
- when fields loaded in, if at final level, then write total scores and changes event of continue button
	- change display to total score, loads total sores

Game
- added getters for nickname, level and total score
	- ScorePopupController's method signatures are much cleaner

scorepopup.css
- element covered over action button, moved out
- background border

- fixed HiscoreReaderTest fro BeforeAll to BeforeEach so both tests work together
- set all scores to %05d
- lowered speed for all lanes by 1

- passes to ScorePopupController that sets Label with String
- ranks according to number of entries

- remove 100 score upon death
- fix wetTurtle's sunk frame
- cleaned up Main
- test file for HiscoreReader


####################################
# 0.14 Maven & Junit Setup 7/12/20
####################################

- Maven framework integration
	- commons.io dependency for file writing
- Junit dependency
- HiscoreWriter class that writes a string to file
- HiscoreWriterTest to test that file is being written
	- a simple test case to see if writing works
- Build Script: mvn clean compile package exec:java

misc

- added hiscore_data to .gitignore


####################################
# 0.13 Collision Refactoring 5/12/20
####################################

- changed CollisionChecker and CollisionHandler to not be singletons anymore, but rather new instances are initiated from Level
	 > this should make things tidier, and remove the need for setter methods
- changed ScorePopupController's init() to initialize(), saving a line of code in SceneSwitcher (since initialize is auto-called)

###################################
# 0.12 Scoring and Nickname 5/12/20
###################################

Scoring
- scoring functions in Frog
- scoring scenarios: forward step (10), score End (50), score 5 ends (1000)
- Level and GameController to update and show

Nickname
- home.fxml text field
- listens and restricts input
- toggle confirmation button that enables the start button

misc
- deleted Digit.java
- Turtles: initialised sprites straight away w/o method call
- removed /model/state, and just put Game and Level under /model


# 0.11b Removed "out" production folder from being committed to remote 5/12/20


##################################
# 0.11 Level Progression 3/12/20
##################################

New view
- scorepopup .fxml and .css and controller
- new SceneSwitcher method
- refactored Game and Level to accommodate loading of new levels and waiting for popup prompt
- continue button to call Game.nextLevel()

Game and Level
- numEndsActivated counter
- when Game's tick detects 5 ends activated, stops game and pop up high scoring box
- clicking continue will load the next consecutive level

LevelBuilder
- built three more levels

Game fxml view
- added level number display at top right
- changed some css styles

CollisionHandler
- player will die when stood on an isSunk WetTurtle
- scoring an End will have method call to Level

misc
- fixed water death anim by reimporting death sprites again

##################################
# 0.10 Collision and Death 3/12/20
##################################

- initSprites Death Animation for Frog

CollisionChecker
- is a singleton utility class that checks for collisions every tick.
- stores references to Level's Actors

CollisionHandler
- is a singleton utility class that handles the consequences of collisions.
- handles all collision possibilities

- Restructured Level to init CollisionChecker with Actors at the start of every round

Frog
- added Death sprites to initSprites()
- all Death Sequences
- Respawn Sequence
- rideActor()
- respawn()
- reset()

End
- all implementations

refactor
- moved tick() from Actor to MovableActor

misc
- death pictures were corrupted, reimported them
- reworded some enums of DeathType
- resized FrogEnd.png

###############################
# 0.10 LevelBuilder 2/12/20
###############################

util and Actors
- LevelBuilder is a singleton utility class that builds an ArrayList of AutoActors using LaneBuilder
	- two levels
- renamed LaneConstructor to LaneBuilder
- changed the widths of all the sprites, making sure they're big enough
- refactored the heights and widths measurements out
x tried randomly generating x-positions for autoactors. too much code
- stored AutoActorDims const file, which is referenced by LaneBuilder and Turtle(s) to load sprites
- GRID_SIZE_L (renamed to A_ACTOR_HEIGHT) shaved down to 28
- Frog dimensions shrunk to 22x22
- removed width field from MovableActor

const
- DeathTypes added three more types, as well as comments
- Global added STAGE_WRAP

- deleted frogger.model.view


###############################
# 0.9 Lane Constructor 28/11/20
###############################

- resized End.png from 62x62 to 62x70
- re-downloaded truck1R truck2R.png and /logs
- fixed FilePath to /turtles, removed TurtleAnim4.png
- fixed Turtle and WetTurtle's sprite dimension parameters

- Level.createEnds() to init the End Actors in position

- Level
	> drawAllActors() to only draw the obstacles, since frog and Ends already drawn
	> advanceLevel() skeleton for eventual advancing level
	> tick() for all Actors in Level

- Refactoring the Actor hierarchy to implement the Prototype design pattern
- MovableActor
	> Renamed DynamicActor -> MovableActor
	> only has move() (to remove??)
- AutoActor
	> Renamed Obstacle -> AutoActor
	> prototype constructor
	> abstr clone()
- Each AutoActor (Car, Log, etc) now has a subclass prototype constructor and a clone() that creates a new object from source

- new LaneConstructor singleton utility class that uses Prototype design pattern
	+ since all lanes have the same objects, only differing in x-coordinate
	+ it copies imageLink URL, y-coord height, width, speed (and x-coord, that will be overwritten)
	- initializes lane's y coordinate according to lane number
	- switch case to determine which AutoActor to load from prototype library, besides init the speed
	- configure prototype
	- Clone prototype
	- return arraylist of lane's AutoActors



###############################
# 0.8 JavaFXML and MVC 25/11/20
###############################

- Used SceneBuilder to create game.fxml, home.fxml and info.fxml
- changed SceneSwitcher to pass fxml files instead of Worlds, and uses fxml to load each root, and makes a Scene with that root
- properly made Controller classes to handle events of buttons from the view, that calls switchScene()
- added the Game model to handle the data and logic during the game

- added constant/Global.java to keep track of global variables if they needed to be changed
- renamed act() to tick()

- moved all the images under resources/images ###
- resources/view
- resources/css
- added resources/fonts/EarlyGameboy.ttf for custom fonts
- Removed iKogsKW.png

- commented out Home.java and State.java
- renamed World.java to Level.java


######################################################
# 0.7 Resources, DyanamicActors and Obstacles 23/11/20
######################################################

- Deleted BackgroundImage
- Renamed Actor into DynamicActor and made it inherit a new class called Actor
    > Actor is for all general sprite objects to add into World
    > DynamicActor are for non-static sprites that need to have tick updates and collision checks
- updated Actor, DynamicActor and World to have their declarations and methods to use the new proper class types
    > applied Liskov's Substitution Principle: Actor can be replaced with DynamicActor
- removed the String imageLink parameter for all constructors of the subclasses of Actor, since they all have their own default sprite (except log and car)
- updated the constructors and some FilePaths for obstacles
- animation methods for Turtles
- added class Car.java, similar to Log

- renamed WetTurtles images


#####################################################
# 0.6 Refactored Structure and Frog Movement 20/11/20
#####################################################

REFACTORED STRUCTURE
- removed HomeController and HomeView (they are still there, commented out, if there might be use for them)
- made Main.java call a new class, SceneSwitcher, a singleton that handles switching scenes
- SceneSwitcher has switchScene() which takes a World and sets its Scene for Main.primaryStage, besides assigning event handler for keystrokes to the World
- World has two methods, keyPressed and keyReleased as the event handler methods which calls frog.leap

CONSTANTS
- Direction.java is an enum that keeps the list of cardinal directions
- Keystroke.java is a class that has a HashMap that matches the WASD KeyCode to their direction
- FilePath.java is a class that stores public static final Strings of the filepaths of resources

FROG SPRITES AND MOVEMENT REDESIGNED
- changed Frog's constructor to include starting co-ords and image size
- two new ArrayLists, facingSprites and leapingSprites
- initSprites() loads these arrays with newly instantiated Images
- leap() takes in direction and which key event is coming in
    > handles exceptions
    > switch statement for each scenario
        > checks for ignoring key events that try to escape boundaries

MISC
- added more parameters to Actor's constructor (+ double startX, double startY, int width, int height)
- cleaned up temporary debug code
- general documentation for all affected code


###########################################
# 0.5 First MVC Module and Music 18/11/20
###########################################

- cleaned up Main.java
- under java/frogger, introduced folders const, util, controller and view
- new HomeView.java and HomeController.java to handle main menu page display and logic respectively (according to MVC pattern)
- Refactored out MyStage
    > HomeView to handle its World extension
    > MusicPlayer to handle music methods

- new MusicPlayer.java as a singleton to handle background music
    > Instead of singleton object, made it as singleton class
- Renamed main/resources/frogger/sound folder to music


###########################################
# 0.4 Frog Movement and Cleanup 16/11/20
###########################################

- Actor.java
    > STAGE_HEIGHT and STAGE_WIDTH constants
    > Javadoc comments
- Animal.java
    > Javadoc comments
    > WATER_HEIGHT
    > GRID_UNIT_L
    > changed rebound value from 2*movement to just movement. Follows the grid.
    > player rebounds on top and bottom boundary
    ! if player spams downwards on any boundary, will misalign with grid because of second animation
- Refactored Animal class renamed to Frog
- Main.java: Renamed animal to frog


###########################################
# 0.3 Element Sizes 15/11/20
###########################################

- resize scene/stage to have a proper grid-like pattern
    H: 40 + 32 + 5*32=160 + 32 + (2+32+2)*5=180 + 52 + 52 == 548
    W: 22 + 13*32 + 22 = 460
- Resized GameBackground.png
- Animal.java
    > both movement directions to have speed of 17
    > static final int for starting coordinates
>> Still need to do boundary wrap checking and fitting


###########################################
# 0.2 Project Workspace Cleanup 15/11/20
###########################################

- updated .gitignore and removed .DS_Store from repo. Hope it works
- set up resource file, and added frogger subfolder
    > refactored code to accommodate subfolder
- deleted (java)docs folder
- renamed changelog file
- cleaned up Main.java file's obstacle bulk



###########################################
# 0.1 Javadocs and File Structure 13/11/20
###########################################

- javadocs 'docs' folder
- file structure reorganisation according to MVC pattern
    > made src/java/frogger as source root directory
    > put all the non-java files into "resources" folder
        > further sub-categorized according to resource type
    > Refactored links/path of methods that use resources
- resized GameBackground to 600x800
- deleted redundant files
    > old README.md
    > frog background-20170521-151438.piskel
    > smiiling-big-eyed-green-frog-clipart-6926.jpg
    > small-red-car-3858-0.png

    > arcade.png



#########################
# Initial Commit 12/11/20
#########################

- set up workspace
- build files folder
- ensured build files






#########################
# KNOWN BUGS
#########################
! Turtles have to be offset -3 on y-axes. Functionality still holds.
! if player holds down key, will be stuck in second animation
! if player does a diagonal combo, the frog will be stuck in second state
! now does not increment linearly by 1
! LaneBuilder's xPerc needs to (4 * StageDimensions.STAGE_WRAP) instead of * 2


# SCORING
X Every forward step scores 10 points,
X and every frog arriving safely home scores 50 points.
10 points are also awarded per each unused 1⁄2 second of time.
Guiding a lady frog home or eating a fly scores 200 points each,
X and when all 5 frogs reach home to end the level the player earns 1,000 points.
A single bonus frog is 20,000 points. (lives?)
